This application is a simulator vending machine. 

A preview file is provided with this solution for easy understanding. It is in the location ..GitHubAssets\gif_preview.gif

The solution focuses on the Full Stack.(Web API, .Net Core, Angular 7)

Here the factory method is used to create the product as it is easy to maintain and easy to test.

Implemented Authentication using JSON Web Token (JWT). But for now only one user is created. 

Tried implementing to send email and created the necessary objects.

1. Run the VendingMachine.WebAPI application using as a start up project.
2. It will run as a console application
3. Once the console application is running , run the angular application (a seperate readme is provided).
